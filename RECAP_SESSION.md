# RECAP_SESSION: Portfolio Visual Redirección (Artisan/Handmade)

## Session Summary
In this session, we evolved the visual identity of the Portfolio section from a "Technical/Industrial" style to an ** "Artisan/Handmade Digital Craft"** aesthetic. 
This change aligns with Manta's core identity, moving away from "chiselled/factory" visuals towards a more human, process-oriented "living canvas" feel.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Conceptual Shift
- **Narrative Change**: Updated `PortfolioSection.tsx` descriptions from "Technical Engraving" to "Artisan Design" and "Digital Workshop".
- **Reference Change**: Updated internal section reference from `BLUEPRINT_ST01` to `ARTISAN_ST01`.

### 2. Video Asset Management
- **Cleanup**: Removed all old `.mp4` and `.png` assets with industrial aesthetics from `public/projects/`.
- **Integration**: Successfully integrated 3 new videos from `creative_assets/` into `public/projects/` with standardized naming:
    - `simonetti.mp4`: Estudio Simonetti (Premium/Authority).
    - `cisb.mp4`: CISB (Institutional/Human).
    - `hub.mp4`: Hospital HUB (Technical/Data).

### 3. AI Prompt Strategies (Brain Logic)
Updated project logic with new strategies for future video iterations:
- **"The Master Cursor" Concept**: Using a white canvas + mouse pointer to show the "crafting" process.
- **Specific Prompts for Whisk & Flow**: Documentation stored in `implementation_plan.md` and `task.md` within the brain directory.

## Project Context Status
- **PortfolioSection.tsx**: Fully updated with artisan narrative and correct video paths.
- **Asset Folders**: Organized and clean.
- **Brand Cohesion**: Strengthened through the process-focused visual storytelling.

## Next Steps Recommended for New Chat
1. **Landing Polish**: Continue verifying the artisan aesthetic across other sections (Manifesto, Services).
2. **Performance**: Check video loading speeds and implement poster frames if needed for the new videos.
3. **Interactive Components**: Explore using similar "hand-drawn/mask" transitions for other UI elements.
